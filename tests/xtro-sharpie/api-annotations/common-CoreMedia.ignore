## block based version of CMBufferQueueCreate (which use callbacks and is already bound)

## block based version of CMAudioSampleBufferCreateWithPacketDescriptions (which use callbacks and is already bound)

## block based version of CMSampleBufferCreateForImageBuffer (which use callbacks and is already bound)

# they are added because we need to be back compatible yet we do have code to choose the correct one

# it can return a Clock or a Timebase but the API already has a way to access the clock source (CMTimebaseCopySourceClock)
# and the Timebase (CMTimebaseCopySourceTimebase) so there is no reason atm to add this method
