## lack of availabilty macros on NSItemProvder.PreferredPresentationStyle - intro says they are not available
## and that also means the (enum/returned) type is unused

## Added on UIAccessibility

## Intent not yet available on tvOS

## Headers says it is available but none of its members or implementor class are available

## enums only exposed from properties marked with UIKIT_CLASS_AVAILABLE_IOS_ONLY(10_0)

## Marked as not in tvOS in Xcode 8.2 beta 1 but it's a breaking change and it's fixed only in XAMCORE_4_0

## headers are unclear (added in iOS9.1) but Apple web documentation does not show those members
## and several only make sense for the stylus touches

## the signature use UILexicon which is not part of tvOS

## the UIActivityItemSource protocol is not marked as unavailable but all it's members use UIActivityViewController which is not allowed on tvOS

## confusing header wrt categories, defined in: UIAdaptivePresentations (UIViewController)
## UIPopoverPresentationController, the returned type, is not available in tvOS

## property not decorated as unavailable but UIPinchGestureRecognizer, the returned type, is not available in tvOS

## Apple renamed NSLineBreakMode from UILineBreakMode and we kept the old name

## Apple renamed NSTextAlignment from NSTextAlignment and we kept the old name

## Ignore what the header files say, the NSItemProviderReading methods are not actually implemented on TV or Watch

## https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues/3213 should be fixed before conformance to 'UIStateRestoring' is restored.

## fixed for XAMCORE_4_0

## not supported as per introspection, rdar filled: 42851110

## Does not make much sense to have it bound in tvOS

## enum only used in iOS API (lack correct decorations on tvOS headers)

# Xcode 11

## Inherited from another protocol

## This is a breaking change

## Not really useful to have them exposed

## UITextInteraction is not available in tvOS

## It is deprecated and not of much use to expose it

## Introduced and deprecated in Xcode 11 and likely it will be removed in a future beta

## Introduced in Xcode 11 b5 but unlikely to be there at the end of beta, these usualy get replaced by NSCopying protocol

## Xcode 11.4 Beta 2
## Duplicated entry field UIKeyInputF1 FB66299477
## https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/wiki/UIKit-iOS-xcode11.4-beta2

# Initial result from new rule extra-null-allowed

# Initial result from new rule missing-null-allowed

## not available on tvOS (iOS 14+ only)

## Enums not needed on tvOS
