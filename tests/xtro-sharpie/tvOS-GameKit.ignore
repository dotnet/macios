!unknown-native-enum! GKPeerPickerConnectionType bound

## GKVoiceChatService is not in tvOS so nothing uses GKVoiceChatClient
!missing-protocol! GKVoiceChatClient not bound

## all members are not available so the protocol is empty

!missing-protocol! GKFriendRequestComposeViewControllerDelegate not bound
## 36619511 Is GKSavedGameListener available on tvOS? (https://trello.com/c/9q0MT7SY)
!missing-protocol! GKSavedGameListener not bound

## GKSavedGameListener is not available on tvOS (see missing-protocol above)
!missing-protocol-conformance! GKLocalPlayer should conform to GKSavedGameListener (defined in 'GKSavedGame' category)

## GKSession is not in the tvOS API but the GKSessionDelegate is not marked
## looks like mistakes as the API is not used anywhere else
## easier to add later, if needed, than remove
!missing-protocol! GKSessionDelegate not bound
