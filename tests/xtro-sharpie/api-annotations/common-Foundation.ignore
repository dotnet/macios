## untyped enums (only values, not type name) NSError.h

## https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=35021

## the API exists but is [Sealed], until XAMCORE_4_0, to keep compatible with iOS/Mac profiles

# missing - pending decision for implementation

## special case, see bug https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=22940

## not recommanded, noted as it _may_ be deprecated in 10.6

## native long is same size as int (.net long is long long)

# fixed in XAMCORE_3_0 - API break

## should not have been [Native] it's 32bits only values -> XAMCORE_4_0

## enum was [re]named to NSCalendarOptions - excluding from XAMCORE_4_0

## collections - many are special





## string scanning, looks helpful (porting code)

# API we decided not to bind, e.g. better alternative in .NET

## Xamarin (not Apple) type

# Apple internals (we do not expose them)

# now (xcode11) marked as deprecated - but never exposed by us

# this is a better named version of `date` which we already bound as `Now` in C#


## unsorted


## Used 'INSFastEnumeration' placeholer (just so we can start flagging things)

## never bound (or requested) for macOS, added to iOS/tvOS/watchOS in xcode10

## found after xtro fix

### NSXPCCoder

# Initial result from new rule extra-null-allowed

# Initial result from new rule missing-null-allowed

## convenience value (combined flags)
