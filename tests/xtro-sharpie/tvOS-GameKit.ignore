## typedef is used + untyped enum in GKPeerPickerController.h: typedef NSUInteger GKPeerPickerConnectionType
!unknown-native-enum! GKPeerPickerConnectionType bound

## GKVoiceChatService is not in tvOS so nothing uses GKVoiceChatClient
!missing-protocol! GKVoiceChatClient not bound

## all members are not available so the protocol is empty
## however this is confusing because some protocols have no members (so it can't just be ignored)
!missing-protocol! GKFriendRequestComposeViewControllerDelegate not bound
!missing-protocol! GKSavedGameListener not bound

## GKSession is not in the tvOS API but the GKSessionDelegate is not marked
## looks like mistakes as the API is not used anywhere else
## easier to add later, if needed, than remove
!missing-protocol! GKSessionDelegate not bound
