## Breaking changes fixed in XAMCORE_4_0
## we cannot add abstract members to existing SCNSceneRenderer or SCNAnimatable protocols (breaking changes)

## same for SCNActionable, it is required member of a protocol added to XAMCORE_4_0

## We have managed counterparts that comes from OpenTK code


## SIMD helpers that we decided not to bind for now

## untyped enum (SceneKitTypes.h) but described as the value of `code` for `NSError` which is an NSInteger

# normal pattern accept null delegate and unit tests shows it works just fine
