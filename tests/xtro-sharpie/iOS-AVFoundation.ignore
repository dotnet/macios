## OSX-only enums - fixed in XAMCORE_3_0
!unknown-native-enum! AVCaptureDeviceTransportControlsPlaybackMode bound
!unknown-native-enum! AVVideoFieldMode bound

## from iOS 4.0 to 5.1
!unknown-field! AVMediaTypeTimedMetadata bound

## no generator support for NSFastEnumeration / https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=4391
!missing-protocol-conformance! AVCaptureSynchronizedDataCollection should conform to NSFastEnumeration

## https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues/3213 should be fixed before conformance to 'AVQueuedSampleBufferRendering' is restored.
!missing-protocol-conformance! AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer should conform to AVQueuedSampleBufferRendering (defined in 'AVSampleBufferDisplayLayerQueueManagement' category)

# Deprecated in iOS 6.0 but we have same C# signature as a method that was deprecated in iOS 8.0
!deprecated-attribute-wrong! AVAudioRecorderDelegate::audioRecorderEndInterruption:withFlags: has 8.0 not 6.0 on [Deprecated] attribute

# Initial result from new rule missing-release-attribute-on-return-value
