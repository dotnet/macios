# Main template that contains all the jobs that are required to run the device tests.
#
# The stage contains two different jobs
# 
# tests: Runs the tests on a pool that contains devices that are capable to run them.
# publish_html: Because vsdrop is not supported on macOS we have an extra job that
#   will run on a pool with Windows devices that will publish the results on VSDrop to
#   be browsable.
