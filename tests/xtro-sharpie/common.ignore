# We only bind "finished" as we cannot use [Bind] here as it would break compatibility with iOS 6.x
# `isFinished` was only added in iOS 7.0 SDK and cannot be called in earlier versions

# it's already defined in the base class, it's fine even if it returns mutable tracks in this case 
!missing-selector! AVMutableComposition::tracks not bound

# AVVideoCompositionInstruction is both a class and a protocol - so we have duplicate entries
# and right now only implement the type (protocol can't have the same name anyway)
