## https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues/3213 should be fixed before conformance to 'AVQueuedSampleBufferRendering' is restored.
!missing-protocol-conformance! AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer should conform to AVQueuedSampleBufferRendering (defined in 'AVSampleBufferDisplayLayerQueueManagement' category)

# as per the header comments, the following two enums have to be ignored on tvOS
!missing-enum! AVAudioSessionIOType not bound
!missing-enum! AVAudioSessionRecordPermission not bound

# removed in TV 12,0, API that used them was removed in TV 10, added obsolete attr.
!unknown-field! AVAssetDownloadTaskMediaSelectionKey bound
!unknown-field! AVAssetDownloadTaskMinimumRequiredMediaBitrateKey bound

# added in TV 12, but makes no sense to bind it because AVCaptureDevice does not exist in tvOS
!missing-field! AVCaptureLensPositionCurrent not bound
