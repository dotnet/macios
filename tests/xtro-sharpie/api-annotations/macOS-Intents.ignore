## Fixed in XAMCORE_4_0 but with a conditional TODO check in code
## API_AVAILABLE(macosx(10.12), ios(10.0)); This is supposed to be there according to availability (Last Review: Feb 2018)

## No availability set on headers, it is possible to be fixed later since makes sense to have in macOS.
## unfortunately it is not at the moment (Last Review: Feb 2018)

## The API that uses the following is unavailable / API_UNAVAILABLE(macosx)

## Do not make sense on macOS, we can bind later if asked

## Apple fixed API availability fixed in XAMCORE_4_0

## Headers say Mac (12,0) but types used in properties are still NoMac
