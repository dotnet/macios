# Build targets for iOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS and tvOS

The following build targets are defined in .NET for iOS, Mac Catalyst, macOS, and tvOS projects.

## Build (Default)

Builds the source code within a project and all dependencies.

## Clean

Removes all files generated by the build process.

## Run

Builds the source code within a project and all dependencies, and then deploys and runs it
on a default simulator/device. A specific deployment target can be set by using the `$(_DeviceName)` property. 

```dotnetcli
dotnet build -t:Run project.csproj -p:_DeviceName=$(MY_DEVICE_UDID)
```
