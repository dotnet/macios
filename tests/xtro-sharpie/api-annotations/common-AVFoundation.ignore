## there's a type of the same name (like NSObject, check what Swift did)

## fixed in XAMCORE_3_0 - API break

## Used only once in a deprecated API, native use `NSInteger` not a real enum - that's why there's a `[Native]`

## native use `NSUInteger` not a real enum - that's why there's a `[Native]`

## it's already defined in the base class, it's fine even if it returns mutable tracks in this case 

## type and protocol are named identically (check the swift name, it's a similar situation to NSObject)

## AVAudioPlayer INTERRUPTION NOTIFICATIONS ARE DEPRECATED - Use AVAudioSession instead.

# Keep [NullAllowed] on FromAsset to keep existing tests passing and allow backwards compatibility

# Initial result from new rule missing-null-allowed

# intro says that this is not true

# no tests/samples

# adding abstract member to an existing type would be a breaking change

# added for XAMCORE_4_0 since it is part of a new breaking change in a notification
