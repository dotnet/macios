## fixed in XAMCORE_3_0 - API break


# Used to remove hard to kill delegate API until .NET

# Fixed in .NET

# The parent enum GKVoiceChatService is not available in macOS 
# so to be honest it does not make much sense to expose this constant on macOS
# nor the below protocols

# This selector does not exist in macOS, confirmed by intro.

# API removed by Apple, marked as deprecated
!unknown-native-enum! GKAuthenticationType bound
# NullAllowed makes sense
!extra-null-allowed! 'System.Void GameKit.GKMatchmaker::FindMatchedPlayers(GameKit.GKMatchRequest,System.Action`2<GameKit.GKMatchedPlayers,Foundation.NSError>)' has a extraneous [NullAllowed] on parameter #1
