<h3><a name="MT0000"/>MT0000: Unexpected error - Please fill a bug report at http://bugzilla.xamarin.com</h3>

An unexpected error condition occurred. Please [file a bug report](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=iOS) with as much information as possible, including:

* Full build logs, with maximum verbosity (e.g. `-v -v -v -v` in the **Additional mtouch arguments**);
* A minimal test case that reproduce the error; and
* All version informations

The easiest way to get exact version information is to use the **Xamarin Studio** menu, **About Xamarin Studio** item, **Show Details** button and copy/paste the version informations (you can use the **Copy Information** button).

<h3><a name="MT0001"/>MT0001: '-devname' was provided without any device-specific action</h3>

This is a warning that is emitted if -devname is passed to mtouch when no device-specific action (-logdev/-installdev/-killdev/-launchdev/-listapps) was requested.

<h3><a name="MT0002"/>MT0002: Could not parse the environment variable *.</h3>

This error happens if you try to set an invalid environment key=value variable pair. The correct format is: `mtouch --setenv=VARIABLE=VALUE`

<h3><a name="MT0003"/>MT0003: Application name '*.exe' conflicts with an SDK or product assembly (.dll) name.</h3>

The executable assembly's name and the application's name can't match the name of any dll in the app. Please modify the name of your executable.

<h3><a name="MT0004"/>MT0004: New refcounting logic requires SGen to be enabled too.</h3>

If you enable the refcounting extension you must also enable the SGen garbage collector in the project's iOS Build options (Advanced tab).

Starting with Xamarin.iOS 7.2.1 this requirement has been lifted, the new refcounting logic can be enabled with both Boehm and SGen Garbage Collectors.

<h3><a name="MT0005"/>MT0005: The output directory * does not exist.</h3>

Please create the directory.

<h3><a name="MT0006"/>MT0006: There is no devel platform at *, use --platform=PLAT to specify the SDK.</h3>

Xamarin.iOS cannot find the SDK directory at the location mentioned in the error message. Please verify that the path is correct.

<h3><a name="MT0007"/>MT0007: The root assembly * does not exist.</h3>

Xamarin.iOS cannot find the assembly at the location mentioned in the error message. Please verify that the path is correct.

<h3><a name="MT0008"/>MT0008: You should provide one root assembly only, found # assemblies: *.</h3>

More than one root assembly was passed to mtouch, while there can be only one root assembly.

<h3><a name="MT0009"/>MT0009: Error while loading assemblies: *.</h3>

An error occurred while loading the assemblies the root assembly references. More information may be provided in the build output.

<h3><a name="MT0010"/>MT0010: Could not parse the command line arguments: *.</h3>

An error occurred while parsing the command line arguments. Please verify that they are all correct.

<h3><a name="MT0011"/>MT0011: * was built against a more recent runtime (*) than MonoTouch supports.</h3>

This warning is typically reported because the project has a reference to a class library that was not built using the Xamarin.iOS BCL.

The same way an app using the .NET 4.0 SDK may not work on a system only supporting .NET 2.0, a library built using .NET 4.0 may not work on Xamarin.iOS, it may use API not present on Xamarin.iOS.

The general solution is to build the library as a Xamarin.iOS Class Library. This can be accomplished by creating a new Xamarin.iOS Class Library project and add all the source files to it. If you do not have the source code for the library, you should contact the vendor and request that they provide a Xamarin.iOS-compatible version of their library.

<h3><a name="MT0012"/>MT0012: Incomplete data is provided to complete *.</h3>

This error is not reported anymore in the current version of Xamarin.iOS.

<h3><a name="MT0013"/>MT0013: Profiling support requires sgen to be enabled too.</h3>

SGen (--sgen) must be enabled if profiling (--profiling) is enabled.

<h3><a name="MT0014"/>MT0014: The iOS * SDK does not support building applications targeting *.</h3>

This can happen in the following circumstances:

*  ARMv6 is enabled and Xcode 4.5 or later is installed.
*  ARMv7s is enabled and Xcode 4.4 or earlier is installed.


Please verify that the installed version of Xcode supports the selected architectures.

<h3><a name="MT0015"/>MT0015: Invalid ABI: *. Supported ABIs are: i386, x86_64,  armv7, armv7+llvm, armv7+llvm+thumb2, armv7s, armv7s+llvm, armv7s+llvm+thumb2, arm64 and arm64+llvm.</h3>

An invalid ABI was passed to mtouch. Please specify a valid ABI.

<h3><a name="MT0016"/>MT0016: The option * has been deprecated.</h3>

The mentioned mtouch option has been deprecated and will be ignored.

<h3><a name="MT0017"/>MT0017: You should provide a root assembly.</h3>

It is required to specify a root assembly (typically the main executable) when building an app.

<h3><a name="MT0018"/>MT0018: Unknown command line argument: *.</h3>

Mtouch does not recognize the command line argument mentioned in the error message.

<h3><a name="MT0019"/>MT0019: Only one --[log|install|kill|launch]dev or --[launch|debug]sim option can be used.</h3>

There are several options for mtouch that can't be used simultaneously:

-  --logdev
-  --installdev
-  --killdev
-  --launchdev
-  --launchdebug
-  --launchsim




<h3><a name="MT0020"/>MT0020 The valid options for '*' are '*'.</h3>



<h3><a name="MT0021"/>MT0021 Cannot compile using gcc/g++ (--use-gcc) when using the static registrar (this is the default when compiling for device). Either remove the --use-gcc flag or use the dynamic registrar (--registrar:dynamic).</h3>



<h3><a name="MT0022"/>MT0022 The options '--unsupported--enable-generics-in-registrar' and '--registrar' are not compatible.</h3>

Remove both the options `--unsupported--enable-generics-in-registrar` and `--registrar`. Starting with Xamarin.iOS 7.2.1 the default registrar supports generics.

<h3><a name="MT0023"/>MT0023 Application name '*.exe' conflicts with another user assembly.</h3>

The executable assembly's name and the application's name can't match the name of any dll in the app. Please modify the name of your executable.

<h3><a name="MT0024"/>MT0024 Could not find required file '*'.</h3>



<h3><a name="MT0025"/>MT0025 No SDK version was provided. Please add `--sdk=X.Y` to specify which iOS SDK should be used to build your application.</h3>



<h3><a name="MT0026"/>MT0026 Could not parse the command line argument '*': *</h3>



<h3><a name="MT0027"/>MT0027 The options '*' and '*' are not compatible.</h3>



<h3><a name="MT0028"/>MT0028 Cannot enable PIE (-pie) when targeting iOS 4.1 or earlier. Please disable PIE (-pie:false) or set the deployment target to at least iOS 4.2</h3>



<h3><a name="MT0029"/>MT0029: REPL (--enable-repl) is only supported in the simulator (--sim).</h3>

REPL is only supported if you're building for the simulator. This means that if you pass `--enable-repl` to mtouch, you must also pass `--sim`.

<h3><a name="MT0030"/>MT0030: The executable name (*) and the app name (*) are different, this may prevent crash logs from getting symbolicated properly.</h3>

When Xcode symbolicates (translates memory addresses to function names and file/line numbers) the process may fail if the executable and app have different names (without the extension).

To fix this either change 'Application Name' in the project's Build/iOS Application options, or change 'Assembly Name' in the project's Build/Output options.

<h3><a name="MT0031"/>MT0031: The command line arguments '--enable-background-fetch' and '--launch-for-background-fetch' require '--launchsim' too.</h3>

<h3><a name="MT0032"/>MT0032: The option '--debugtrack' is ignored unless '--debug' is also specified.</h3>

<h3><a name="MT0033"/>MT0033  A Xamarin.iOS project must reference either monotouch.dll or Xamarin.iOS.dll</h3>

<h3><a name="MT0034"/>MT0034  Cannot include both 'monotouch.dll' and 'Xamarin.iOS.dll' in the same Xamarin.iOS project - '*' is referenced explicitly, while '*' is referenced by '*'.</h3>

<h3><a name="MT0036"/>MT0036  Cannot launch a * simulator for a * app. Please enable the correct architecture(s) in your project's iOS Build options (Advanced page).</h3>

<h3><a name="MT0037"/>MT0037  monotouch.dll is not 64-bit compatible. Either reference Xamarin.iOS.dll, or do not build for a 64-bit architecture (ARM64 and/or x86_64).</h3>

<h3><a name="MT0038"/>MT0038  The old registrars (--registrar:oldstatic|olddynamic) are not supported when referencing Xamarin.iOS.dll.</h3>

<h3><a name="MT0039"/>MT0039  Applications targeting ARMv6 cannot reference Xamarin.iOS.dll.</h3>

<h3><a name="MT0040"/>MT0040  Could not find the assembly '*', referenced by '*'.</h3>

<h3><a name="MT0041"/>MT0041  Cannot reference both 'monotouch.dll' and 'Xamarin.iOS.dll'.</h3>

<h3><a name="MT0042"/>MT0042  No reference to either monotouch.dll or Xamarin.iOS.dll was found. A reference to monotouch.dll will be added.</h3>

<h3><a name="MT0043"/>MT0043: The Boehm garbage collector is currently not supported when referencing 'Xamarin.iOS.dll'. The SGen garbage collector has been selected instead.</h3>

Only the SGen garbage collector is supported with Unified projects. Ensure there are no additional mtouch flags specifying Boehm as the garbage collector.

<h3><a name="MT0044"/>MT0044: --listsim is only supported with Xcode 6.0 or later.</h3>

Install a newer Xcode version.

<h3><a name="MT0045"/>MT0045: --extension is only supported when using the iOS 8.0 (or later) SDK.</h3>

<!-- MT0046 is not reported anymore -->

<h3><a name="MT0047"/>MT0047: The minimum deployment target for Unified applications is 5.1.1, the current deployment target is '*'. Please select a newer deployment target in your project's iOS Application options.</h3>

<!-- MT0048 is not reported anymore -->

<h3><a name="MT0049"/>MT0049: *.framework is supported only if deployment target is 8.0 or later. * features might not work correctly.</h3>

The specified framework is not supported in the iOS version the deployment target refers to. Either update the deployment target to a newer iOS version, or remove usage of the specified framework from the app.

<!-- MT0050 is not reported anymore -->

<h3><a name="MT0051"/>MT0051: Xamarin.iOS * requires Xcode 5.0 or later. The current Xcode version (found in *) is *.</h3>

<h3><a name="MT0056"/>MT0056: Cannot find Xcode in the default location (/Applications/Xcode.app). Please install Xcode, or pass a custom path using --sdkroot <path>.</h3>
<h3><a name="MT0057"/>MT0057: Cannot determine the path to Xcode.app from the sdk root '*'. Please specify the full path to the Xcode.app bundle.</h3>

The path passed using `--sdkroot` does not specify a valid Xcode app. Please specify a path to an Xcode app.

<h3><a name="MT0058"/>MT0058: The Xcode.app '*' is invalid (the file '*' does not exist).</h3>

The path passed using `--sdkroot` does not specify a valid Xcode app. Please specify a path to an Xcode app.

<h3><a name="MT0059"/>MT0059: Could not find the currently selected Xcode on the system: *</h3>

<h3><a name="MT0060"/>MT0060: Could not find the currently selected Xcode on the system. 'xcode-select --print-path' returned '*', but that directory does not exist.</h3>

<h3><a name="MT0061"/>MT0061: No Xcode.app specified (using --sdkroot), using the system Xcode as reported by 'xcode-select --print-path': *</h3>

This is a informational warning, explaining which Xcode will be used, since none was specified.

Xamarin.iOS only supports embedded frameworks when using the Unified API; please update your project to use the Unified API.

<h3><a name="MT0065"/>MT0065: Xamarin.iOS only supports embedded frameworks when deployment target is at least 8.0 (current deployment target: * embedded frameworks: *)</h3>

Xamarin.iOS only supports embedded frameworks when the deployment target is at least 8.0 (because earlier versions of iOS does not support embedded frameworks).

Please update the deployment target in the project's Info.plist to 8.0 or higher.

<h3><a name="MT0066"/>MT0066: Invalid build registrar assembly: *</h3>

This usually indicates a bug in Xamarin.iOS; please file a bug report at http://bugzilla.xamarin.com with a test case.

<h3><a name="MT0067"/>MT0067: Invalid registrar: *</h3>

This usually indicates a bug in Xamarin.iOS; please file a bug report at http://bugzilla.xamarin.com with a test case.

<h3><a name="MT0068"/>MT0068: Invalid value for target framework: *.</h3>

<h3><a name="MT0073"/>MT0073: Xamarin.iOS * does not support a deployment target of * (the minimum is *). Please select a newer deployment target in your project's Info.plist.</h3>

The minimum deployment target is the one specified in the error message; please select a newer deployment target in the project's Info.plist.

If updating the deployment target is not possible, then please use an older version of Xamarin.iOS.

<h3><a name="MT0074"/>MT0074: Xamarin.iOS * does not support a minimum deployment target of * (the maximum is *). Please select an older deployment target in your project's Info.plist or upgrade to a newer version of Xamarin.iOS.</h3>

Xamarin.iOS does not support setting the minimum deployment target to a higher version than the version this particular version of Xamarin.iOS was built for.

Please select an older minimum deployment target in the project's Info.plist, or upgrade to a newer version of Xamarin.iOS.

<h3><a name="MT0075"/>MT0075: Invalid architecture '*' for * projects. Valid architectures are: *</h3>

An invalid architecture was specified. Please verify that architecture is valid.

<h3><a name="MT0076"/>MT0075: No architecture specified (using the --abi argument). An architecture is required for * projects.</h3>

This usually indicates a bug in Xamarin.iOS; please file a bug report at http://bugzilla.xamarin.com with a test case.

<h3><a name="MT0077"/>MT0076: WatchOS projects must be extensions.</h3>

This usually indicates a bug in Xamarin.iOS; please file a bug report at http://bugzilla.xamarin.com with a test case.

<h3><a name="MT0078"/>MT0077: Incremental builds are enabled with a deployment target < 7.0 (currently *). This is not supported (the resulting application will not launch on iOS 9), so the deployment target will be set to 7.0.</h3>

This is a warning informing that the deployment target has been set to 7.0 for this build so that incremental builds work properly.

Incremental builds are only supported when the deployment target is at least 7.0 (because the resulting application will not launch on iOS 9 otherwise).

<h3><a name="MT0079"/>MT0078: The recommended Xcode version for Xamarin.iOS * is Xcode * or later. The current Xcode version (found in *) is *.</h3>

This is a warning informing that the current version of Xcode is not the recommended version of Xcode for this version of Xamarin.iOS.

Please upgrade Xcode in order to ensure optimal behavior.

<h3><a name="MT0080"/>MT0080: Disabling NewRefCount, --new-refcount:false, is deprecated.</h3>

This is a warning informing that the request to disable the new refcount (--new-refcount:false) has been ignored.

The new refcount feature is now mandatory for all projects, and it's thus not possible to disable anymore.

<h3><a name="MT0081"/>MT0081: The command line argument --download-crash-report also requires --download-crash-report-to.</h3>
<h3><a name="MT0082"/>MT0082: REPL (--enable-repl) is only supported when linking is not used (--nolink).</h3>
<h3><a name="MT0083"/>MT0083: Asm-only bitcode is not supported on watchOS. Use either --bitcode:marker or --bitcode:full.</h3>
<h3><a name="MT0084"/>MT0084: Bitcode is not supported in the simulator. Do not pass --bitcode when building for the simulator.</h3>
<h3><a name="MT0085"/>MT0085: No reference to '*' was found. It will be added automatically.</h3>
<h3><a name="MT0086"/>MT0086: A target framework (--target-framework) must be specified when building for TVOS or WatchOS.</h3>

This usually indicates a bug in Xamarin.iOS; please file a bug report at http://bugzilla.xamarin.com with a test case.

<h3><a name="MT0087"/>MT0087: Incremental builds (--fastdev) is not supported with the Boehm GC. Incremental builds will be disabled.</h3>
<h3><a name="MT0091"/>MT0091: This version of Xamarin.iOS requires the * SDK (shipped with Xcode *) when the managed linker is disabled. Either upgrade Xcode, or enable the managed linker.</h3>

This version of Xamarin.iOS requires the SDK specified in the error message if the managed linker is disabled.

This is because the app must be built with an SDK that contains all the native API the app uses, and if the managed linker is disabled, the app will use all the API shipped with this version Xamarin.iOS.

The recommended way to fix this error is to upgrade Xcode to get the required SDK.

A potential alternative solution is to enable the managed linker (although this may not work if your project uses API that was introduced in the required SDK).

A last-straw solution would be to use a different version of Xamarin.iOS, one that supports the SDK your project requires.

<h3><a name="MT1008"/>MT1008: Failed to launch the simulator</h3>



This error is reported if mtouch failed to launch the
  simulator.   This can happen sometimes because there is
  already a stale or dead simulator process running.

The following command issued on the Unix command line can
  be used to kill stuck simulator processes:

```
$ launchctl list|grep UIKitApplication|awk '{print $3}'|xargs launchctl remove

<h3><a name="MT1018"/>MT1018: Your application failed code-signing checks and could not be installed on the device '*'. Check your certificates, provisioning profiles, and bundle ids. Probably your device is not part of the selected provisioning profile (error: 0xe8008015).</h3>
<h3><a name="MT1019"/>MT1019: Your application has entitlements not supported by your current provisioning profile and could not be installed on the device '*'. Please check the iOS Device Log for more detailed information (error: 0xe8008016).</h3>

This can happen if:

<ul>
  <li>Your application has entitlements that the current provisioning profile does not support. <br/>
    Possible solutions:
    <ul>
    <li>Specify a different provisioning profile that supports the entitlements your application needs.</li>
    <li>Remove the entitlements not supported in current provisioning profile.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The device you're trying to deploy to is not included in the provisioning profile you're using.<br/>
    Possible solutions:
    <ul>
      <li>Create a new app from a template in Xcode, select the same provisioning profile, and deploy to same device. Sometimes Xcode can automatically refresh provisioning profiles with new devices (in other cases Xcode will ask you what to do).</li>
      <li>Go to the iOS Dev Center and update the provisioning profile with the new device, then download the updated provisioning profile to your machine.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

In most cases more information about the failure will be printed to the iOS Device Log, which can help diagnosing the issue.

<h3><a name="MT4101"/>MT4101 The registrar cannot build a signature for type `*`.</h3>

A type was found in exported API that the runtime doesn't know how to marshal to/from Objective-C.

If you believe Xamarin.iOS should support the type in question, please file an enhancement request at [http://bugzilla.xamarin.com](http://bugzilla.xamarin.com).

<h3><a name="MT4102"/>MT4102 The registrar found an invalid type `*` in signature for method `*`. Use `*` instead.</h3>

This currently only happens with one type: System.DateTime. Use the Objective-C equivalent (NSDate) instead.

<h3><a name="MT4103"/>MT4103 The registrar found an invalid type `*` in signature for method `*`: The type implements INativeObject, but does not have a constructor that takes two (IntPtr, bool) arguments</h3>

This occurs when the registrar encounter a type in a signature with the mentioned characteristics. The registrar might need to create new instances of the type, and in this case it requires a constructor with the (IntPtr, bool) signature - the first argument (IntPtr) specifies the managed handle, while the second if the caller hands over ownership of the native handle (if this value is false 'retain' will be called on the object).

<h3><a name="MT4104"/>MT4104 The registrar cannot marshal the return value for type `*` in signature for method `*`.</h3>

<h3><a name="MT4141"/>MT4141  Cannot register the selector '*' on the member '*' because Xamarin.iOS implicitly registers this selector.</h3>

This occurs when subclassing a framework type, and trying to implement a 'retain', 'release' or 'dealloc' method:

```
class MyNSObject : NSObject
{
	[Export ("retain")]
	new void Retain () {}

	[Export ("release")]
	new void Release () {}

	[Export ("dealloc")]
	new void Dealloc () {}
}
```

It is however possible to override these methods if the class isn't the first subclass of the framework type:

```
class MyNSObject : NSObject
{
}

class MyCustomNSObject : MyNSObject
{
	[Export ("retain")]
	new void Retain () {}

	[Export ("release")]
	new void Release () {}

	[Export ("dealloc")]
	new void Dealloc () {}
}
```

In this case Xamarin.iOS will override `retain`, `release` and `dealloc` on the `MyNSObject` class, and there is no conflict.

<h3><a name="MT5210"/>MT5210: Native linking failed, undefined symbol: *. Please verify that all the necessary frameworks have been referenced and native libraries are properly linked in.</h3>

This happens when the native linker cannot find a symbol that is referenced somewhere. There are several reasons this may happen:<ul>
  <li>A third-party binding requires a framework, but the binding does not specify this in its <code>[LinkWith]</code> attribute. Solutions:
    <ul>
      <li>If you're the author of the third-party binding, or have access to its source, modify the binding's <code>[LinkWith]</code> attribute to include the framework it needs: <code class=" syntax brush-C#">[LinkWith ("mylib.a", Frameworks = "SystemConfiguration")]</code>
      </li>
      <li>If you can't modify the third-party binding, you can manually link with the required framework by passing <code>-gcc_flags '-framework SystemFramework'</code> to mtouch (this is done by modifying the additional mtouch arguments in the project's iOS Build options page. Remember that this must be done for every project configuration).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In some cases a managed binding is composed of several native libraries, and all must be included in the bindings. It is possible to have more than one native library in each binding project, so the solution is to just add all the required native libraries to the binding project.</li>
  <li>A managed binding refers to native symbols that don't exist in the native library.
      This usually happens when a binding has existed for some time, and the native
      code has been modified during that time so that a particular native class has
      either been removed or renamed, while the binding has not been updated.</li>
  <li>A P/Invoke refers to a native symbol that does not exist. Starting with Xamarin.iOS 7.4 an <a href="#MT5214">MT5214</a> error will be reported for this case (see MT5214 for more information).</li>
  <li>A third-party binding / library was built using C++, but the binding does not specify this in its <code>[LinkWith]</code> attribute. This is usually fairly easy to recognize, because the symbols have are mangled C++ symbols (one common example is <code>__ZNKSt9exception4whatEv</code>).
    <ul>
      <li>If you're the author of the third-party binding, or have access to its source, modify the binding's <code>[LinkWith]</code> attribute to set the <code>IsCxx</code> flag: <code class=" syntax brush-C#">[LinkWith ("mylib.a", IsCxx = true)]</code>
      </li>
      <li>If you can't modify the third-party binding, or you're linking manually with a third-party library, you can set the equivalent flag by passing <code>-cxx</code> to mtouch (this is done by modifying the additional mtouch arguments in the project's iOS Build options page. Remember that this must be done for every project configuration).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>



<h3><a name="MT5211"/>MT5211: Native linking failed, undefined Objective-C class: *. The symbol '*' could not be found in any of the libraries or frameworks linked with your application.</h3>

This happens when the native linker cannot find an Objective-C class that is referenced somewhere. There are several reasons this may happen: the same as for [MT5210](#MT5210) and in addition:<ul>
    <li>
      A third-party binding bound an Objective-C protocol, but did not annotate it with the <code>[Protocol]</code> attribute in its api definition. Solutions:
      <ul>
        <li>If you're the author of the third-party binding, or have access to its source, add the missing <code>[Protocol]</code> attribute:
    <pre><code class=" syntax brush-C#">[BaseType (typeof (NSObject))]
[Protocol] // Add this
public interface MyProtocol
{
}</code></pre>
    </li>
      <li>If you can't modify the third-party binding, build your project with the legacy static registrar by adding <code>--registrar:oldstatic</code> to the additional mtouch arguments in the project's iOS Build options page.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>



<h3><a name="MT5212"/>MT5212: Native linking failed, duplicate symbol: *.</h3>

This happens when the native linker encounters duplicated symbols between all the native libraries. Following this error there may be one or more [MT5213](#MT5213) errors with the location for each occurrence of the symbol. Possible reasons for this error:

<ul>
    <li>The same native library is included twice.</li>
    <li>Two distinct native libraries happen to define the same symbols.</li>
    <li>A native library is not correctly built, and contains the same symbol more than once.
      You can confirm this by using the following set of commands from a terminal (replace i386 with x86_64/armv7/armv7s/arm64 according to which architecture you're building for):
<pre><code>  # Native libraries are usually fat libraries, containing binary code for
  # several architectures in the same file. First we extract the binary 
  # code for the architecture we're interested in.
  lipo libNative.a -thin i386 -output libNative.i386.a

  # Now query the native library for the duplicated symbol.
  nm libNative.i386.a | fgrep 'SYMBOL'

  # You can also list the object files inside the native library.
  # In most cases this will reveal duplicated object files.
  ar -t libNative.i386.a</code></pre>

      There are a few possible ways to fix this:
      <ul>
        <li>Request that the provider of the native library fix it and provide the updated version.</li>
        <li>Fix it yourself by removing the extra object files (this only works if the problem is in fact duplicated object files)
<pre><code>  # Find out if the library is a fat library, and which 
  # architectures it contains.
  lipo -info libNative.a

  # Extract each architecture (i386/x86_64/armv7/armv7s/arm64) to a separate file
  lipo libNative.a -thin ARCH -output libNative.ARCH.a

  # Extract the object files for the offending architecture
  # This will remove the duplicates by overwriting them
  # (since they have the same filename)
  mkdir -p ARCH
  cd ARCH
  ar -x ../libNative.ARCH.a

  # Reassemble the object files in an .a
  ar -r ../libNative.ARCH.a *.o
  cd ..

  # Reassemble the fat library
  lipo *.a -create -output libNative.a</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Ask the linker to remove unused code. Xamarin.iOS will do this automatically if all of the following conditions are met:
          <ul>
            <li>All third-party bindings' <code>[LinkWith]</code> attributes have enabled SmartLink:
<code><pre>[assembly: LinkWith ("libNative.a", SmartLink = true)]</pre></code>
            </li>
            <li>No <code>-gcc_flags</code> is passed to mtouch (in the additional mtouch arguments field of the project's iOS Build options).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>It's also possible to ask the linker directly to remove unused code by adding `-gcc_flags -dead_strip` to the additional mtouch arguments in the project's iOS Build options.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="MT5213"/>MT5213: Duplicate symbol in: * (Location related to previous error)</h3>

This error is reported only together with [MT5212](#MT5212). Please see [MT5212](#MT5212) for more information.

<h3><a name="MT5214"/>MT5214  Native linking failed, undefined symbol: *. This symbol was referenced the managed member *. Please verify that all the necessary frameworks have been referenced and native libraries linked.</h3>

This error is reported when the managed code contains a P/Invoke to a native method that does not exist. For example:

```
using System.Runtime.InteropServices; 
class MyImports { 
   [DllImport ("__Internal")] 
   public static extern void MyInexistentFunc (); 
}
```

There are a few possible solutions:

  -  Remove the P/Invokes in question from the source code. 
  -  Enable the managed linker for all assemblies (this is done in the project's iOS Build options, by setting "Linker Behavior" to "All assemblies"). This will effectively remove all the P/Invokes you don't use from the app (automatically, instead of manually like the previous point). The downside is that this will make your simulator builds somewhat slower, and it may break your app if it's using reflection - more information about the linker can be found  [here](/guides/ios/advanced_topics/linker/) ) 
  -  Create a second native library which contains the missing native symbols. Note that this is merely a workaround (if you happen to try to call those functions, your app will crash). 

<h3><a name="MT5215"/>MT5215: References to '*' might require additional -framework=XXX or -lXXX instructions to the native linker</h3>

This is a warning, indicating that a P/Invoke was detected to reference the library in question, but the app is not linking with it.
