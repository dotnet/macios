## deprecated (as the name indicates) and not exposed

## there's another P/Invoke that returns the same result according to the documentation (CGColorSpaceCopyName), so no need to bind another one.

# There's an identical function that takes a C callback instead of a block, and which we've bound, which makes this function redundant since the managed API would be identical.

# not yet sure how to bind this

## unsorted
