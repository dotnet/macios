## incorrect macro/parsing - decorated with `MP_API(macos(10.12.2))`

## marked as available in tvOS 11 but the member is not and using a type, MPMusicPlayerQueueDescriptor, that's not available

## shown as available in iOS 9.3 in tvOS header files (from Xcode 7.3) so normally available in tvOS 9.2 
## In reality it's only available in the simulator, not on AppleTV devices (all fields are null)

## _added_ in xcode12 but already deprecated in iOS9 (likely error in headers)
