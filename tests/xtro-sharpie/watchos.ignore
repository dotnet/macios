# UIKit

## Implemented in managed code
!missing-selector! UIColor::getHue:saturation:brightness:alpha: not bound
!missing-selector! UIColor::getRed:green:blue:alpha: not bound

## Not implemented (ctor signature conflict) but there's a static method available that does the job
!missing-selector! UIColor::initWithHue:saturation:brightness:alpha: not bound


# Apple internals (we do not expose them)

!missing-field! _NSConstantStringClassReference not bound
