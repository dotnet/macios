# Apple headers: Deprecated in iOS 7

## All GKSessionError values were deprecated in iOS7 and we never bound then (no point in adding it now)

## enum size declared after the enum, e.g. `typedef NSInteger GKInviteeResponse;`, so we miss the metadata

# Xcode 12 beta 3 - these API are missing
# https://github.com/xamarin/maccore/issues/2269

## properties are null by default (not changing their behaviour to remain compatible)

## unsorted
